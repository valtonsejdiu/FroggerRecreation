Frogger 1981 game implemented in java - Recreation

The realization of a modern version of the game "Frogger - 1981" in Java was realized by 10 different classes of which are 5 Model classes "Frog.java", "Obstacle.java", "AllObstacle.java", "PlayerStats.java", "Logic.java", 1 visual (View) class "Gui.java", 3 Control classes "ControlKeys.java", "GameController.java", "Main.java" and 1 interface "obstacleInterface.java" based on the MVC model.
The game includes the timer, lives and score that the player achieves during the game.
The lifespan is 60 seconds and there are 3 lives in total.
The score is calculated so that when the frog reaches the target, 100 points plus the remaining seconds multiplied by 10 are added to the previous score.
Game controls to move the frog are arrow keys and W, A, S, D.
